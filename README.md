# MOONERO
Slight modification of the WATCH-DOGE program. XMR to the moon!

Just a simple modification of WATCH-DOGE, this time plotting directly with matplotlib instead of mplfinance and including graphs for other cryptocurrencies. The idea is to witness the price evolution of Monero since it was launched in 18. April 2014, while also comparing it with the price evolution of Bitcoin and Ethereum.
